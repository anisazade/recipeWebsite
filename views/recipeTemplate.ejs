                    <p>There’s something magical about homemade ravioli. The soft, delicate pasta
                    cradling a creamy, cheesy filling feels like a warm hug from the past—a dish
                    that carries generations of tradition and love.</p>

                    <p>I remember the first time I tried making ravioli with my grandmother in her
                    tiny, flour-dusted kitchen. She would hum softly as she rolled out the pasta
                    dough, her hands moving with the precision of someone who had done this a
                    thousand times before.</p>

                    <p>"The secret," she would say, "is in the filling. You can have the best pasta
                    in the world, but if the filling isn't perfect, it won’t taste like home."
                    And so, we made the filling—a blend of ricotta, Parmesan, and a hint of nutmeg,
                    with just enough mozzarella to give it that irresistible stretch. I remember
                    sneaking a spoonful before it even made it into the pasta squares, savoring the
                    creamy, slightly tangy, and utterly indulgent taste.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the ravioli boiled, the kitchen filled with a rich, buttery aroma. 
                    We topped them with a simple sage-infused brown butter sauce, letting the 
                    nutty, slightly crispy sage leaves bring out the cheese’s depth. 
                    Each bite melted in my mouth—soft pasta, creamy cheese, 
                    and the warmth of a dish made with care.</p>
                    <p>Now, every time I make ravioli, I remember that afternoon with my grandmother
                    ,where food was more than just sustenance—it was a way to share love, tradition,
                    and memories.</p>
